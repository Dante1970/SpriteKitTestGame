## Description

This is a game written using UIKit and SpriteKit, inspired by **Crossy Road**.  
The objective of the game is to survive for one minute while avoiding obstacles and not colliding with cars.  
You must keep moving because the camera is constantly scrolling upward. If your character falls off the screen, the game ends.
